# rruleref — a cross-implementation conformance corpus for RFC 5545 RRULE

Recurrence rules are a small spec that almost everything gets slightly wrong.
There is no official conformance suite for RFC 5545 `RRULE`. Each library ships
its own regression tests, which by construction can never disagree with the
library that wrote them, so a whole class of defect survives indefinitely: the
kind where an implementation is confidently and consistently wrong.

This repository is an attempt at the missing artifact — a language-neutral
corpus of `RRULE` + `DTSTART` → expected occurrences, in plain JSON, with the
expected values derived from the spec rather than copied from any one library.

## How a case earns its place

Expected values are not taken from a reference implementation, because then the
corpus would just encode that implementation's bugs.

Instead there are two expanders that share no code:

- `src/naive.py` — a deliberately naive brute-force expander written from the
  text of RFC 5545 §3.3.10. It enumerates every candidate datetime and asks "is
  this an occurrence?" as a predicate. It is far too slow for production and far
  easier to check by eye against the spec, which is the point.
- `python-dateutil`, which uses completely different interval-skipping
  machinery.

A case goes into `corpus/corroborated.json` only when both agree. Independent
agreement is evidence, not proof — but it is much stronger evidence than any
single library's self-consistency.

When they disagree, the case goes to `corpus/disputed.json` and is adjudicated
by hand against the spec. Some disagreements are bugs in my expander (most of
them were, and fixing those is how it earned trust). Some are bugs in the other
implementation. Some are places the spec genuinely does not decide.

Current state: **2548 corroborated cases** (1232 with a spec-defined,
synchronized `DTSTART`; see the next section — this is up from 149, after a
generator fix on 2026-09-05) and **18 disputed**, of which 12 are
**unadjudicated open questions**, not findings.

The 18 disputes fall into two shapes: `FREQ=WEEKLY` + `BYSETPOS` differing in
the first period only, and `BYWEEKNO` at the year boundary (Finding 002).
Neither is currently claimed to be a bug in anything. Adjudicating the first
shape requires a third independent implementation, because the two present
expanders also disagree about whether the spec defines those cases at all.
Deliberately left open rather than written up — the previous version of this
README overclaimed on exactly this material.

## Synchronized vs unsynchronized `DTSTART` — read this before using the corpus

RFC 5545 §3.8.5.3:

> The "DTSTART" property value SHOULD be synchronized with the recurrence rule,
> if specified. The recurrence set generated with a "DTSTART" property value
> not synchronized with the recurrence rule is undefined.

Every case therefore carries `dtstart_synchronized`. It is `true` when `DTSTART`
is itself the rule's first occurrence, i.e. when the spec defines an answer at
all.

- `dtstart_synchronized: true` — a **conformance** expectation. A library
  disagreeing here has a defensible bug report against it.
- `dtstart_synchronized: false` — an **interop observation**. Two independent
  expanders agreeing about behavior the spec leaves undefined establishes a de
  facto convention, and nothing more. Useful for compatibility work; **not**
  citable as a spec violation.

### The flag's own limitation

`dtstart_synchronized` is computed with the naive expander — which is one of the
two parties whose agreement the corpus is built on. Where the two expanders
disagree, they may also disagree about whether `DTSTART` was synchronized at
all, so the flag is implementation-relative in exactly the cases that matter
most. It is trustworthy on corroborated cases (both agree, so the first
occurrence is not in question) and should be read with suspicion on disputed
ones. Resolving that needs a third independent implementation, which is the next
planned work. This caveat was found within an hour of adding the flag, and is
recorded rather than smoothed over.

This distinction was missing from the corpus until 2026-09-05, and its absence
directly produced a false bug finding (see Findings 001). The generator
originally chose `DTSTART` independently of the rule, so about 90% of cases sat
in the undefined region while the README described the whole corpus as
"corroborated" without qualification. The generator now derives a synchronized
`DTSTART` for each rule as well, so the defined region is genuinely covered
rather than incidental.

## Findings

- [001 — `FREQ=WEEKLY` + `BYSETPOS` at an unsynchronized `DTSTART`](findings/001-dateutil-weekly-bysetpos.md).
  **Withdrawn as a bug on 2026-09-05**; it was previously listed here as a
  confirmed `python-dateutil` defect. It is not one. The reproduction used a
  `DTSTART` not synchronized with the rule, and RFC 5545 §3.8.5.3 declares the
  recurrence set undefined in exactly that case. With a synchronized `DTSTART`
  dateutil is correct. Nothing was ever sent upstream. Retained as a recorded
  behavioral difference, which is still useful data.
- [002 — `BYWEEKNO` at the year boundary](findings/002-byweekno-year-boundary.md).
  A spec ambiguity, deliberately **not** filed as a bug. RFC 5545 does not say
  which week owns the first days of January when they fall in the previous
  year's last week, and implementations diverge. Recorded as disputed.

## Known-answer tests

`tests/rfc_examples.py` checks the naive expander against the worked examples
in RFC 5545 §3.8.5.3 — the one source of expected values that comes from
neither expander, so it tests the method rather than the two implementations
against each other. All 10 pass, including the `WKST` pair the RFC uses to show
that `WKST` changes the answer and both `BYSETPOS` examples.

### Correction, 2026-09-05

An earlier version of this README, of `tests/rfc_examples.py`, and of the
project journal claimed to have found **an erratum in RFC 5545's own example
text**. There is no erratum. The claim was manufactured, not observed.

What happened: §3.3.10 mentions `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYSETPOS=-1`
in prose as a way to say "the last work day of the month", and gives **no
expected output for it**. The worked example in §3.8.5.3 is a *different* rule,
`BYSETPOS=-2` ("the second-to-last weekday"), and its printed results —
September 29, October 30, November 27, December 30, 1997 — are correct. The
`-1` rule was paired with expected values assembled around the `-2` example's
dates, the mismatch was then attributed to the RFC, and the string quoted as
what "the RFC prints" appears nowhere in RFC 5545.

Both real examples are now in `tests/rfc_examples.py` verbatim, and the naive
expander reproduces both. 10/10 known-answer tests pass.

The lesson is recorded because it is the failure mode this project exists to
guard against: expected values must be traced to their source, and a
disagreement with a spec is far more likely to be a misreading of the spec.

Found by the Human observer, not by me.

## Layout

```
src/naive.py         spec-derived brute-force expander
tests/rfc_examples.py  known-answer tests from RFC 5545 sec. 3.8.5.3
src/differ.py        random rule generator + differential comparison
src/build_corpus.py  runs the differential and writes the corpus
corpus/              corroborated.json, disputed.json
findings/            adjudicated divergences, written up
```

## Running it

`python-dateutil` is the only dependency and only the *builder* needs it; the
corpus itself is plain JSON and can be consumed by anything.

```sh
python3 src/differ.py 7 300      # differential run, seed 7, 300 rules
python3 src/build_corpus.py      # rebuild corpus/ (slow; minutes)
python3 tests/rfc_examples.py    # known-answer tests, no dependencies
```

## Honest limits

- Only two implementations, and one of them is mine. Two independent expanders
  agreeing is real evidence but a third would be worth more than doubling the
  case count. No other runtime is installed here yet; that is a thing to fix,
  not a boundary. A pure-Python implementation from PyPI is the cheapest third
  opinion and is the next planned step.
- Everything here is naive-datetime. No timezones, no DST, no `VTIMEZONE`.
  That is a deliberate scope cut, not an oversight: DST transitions deserve
  their own corpus and would otherwise contaminate this one.
- The generator does not yet emit `FREQ=HOURLY/MINUTELY/SECONDLY`, `UNTIL`, or
  `COUNT` combinations, so the corpus says nothing about them.
- Coverage is random, not systematic. It is not yet a claim of completeness.
